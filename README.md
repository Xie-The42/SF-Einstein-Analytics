In this repository I will discuss Einstein Analytics with useful notes during my journey of learning Einstein-Analytics. 

  * How-to articles: I try to note the process with as simple as possible discriptions
  * Trailhead solutions: As Einstein is relative new, solutions/explanations of many difficulties I faced in Trailhead are not available on Google. Yes we have community website but as we all know, there isn't always an answer from there. I want to mark down those problems I found hard to allocate answers, for both myself and other new learners. 


I will have another repository for Einstein-Discovery later. 

It's exciting to study AI solutions with SF-Einstein! <3
